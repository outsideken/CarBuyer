A Shiny Car Pricing App for the Mazda CX-5

This app uses a simple linear regression using the Model Year and Vehicle Mileage as features to predict the price for out-of-sample CX-5s.  This model was built to help a friend buy a new car and and only cars with All-Wheel Drive (AWD), Leather Seats, and the Technology Package options were considered (and thus constants) and therefore not considered as model features.

Admittedly a very limited application, but a quick fun way to use data science to help a friend buy a car.
